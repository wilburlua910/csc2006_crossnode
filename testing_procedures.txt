Testing Procedure:

Latency time: Publishing 1 edge to 1 controller
1. Get latency for MQTT publish from Edge_1 to mqttSubscriber using QoS(0)
2. Get latency for MQTT publish from Edge_1 to mqttSubscriber using QoS(1) retain=True
3. Get latency for MQTT publish from Edge_1 to mqttSubscriber using QoS(2) retain=True

Latency time: Subscribing 1 controller to 1 edge
1. Get latency time for MQTT to subscribe from mqttSubscriber to Edge_1 using QoS(0) 
2. Get latency time for MQTT to subscribe from mqttSubscriber to Edge_1 using QoS(1) retain=True
3. Get latency time for MQTT to subscribe from mqttSubscriber to Edge_1 using QoS(2) retain=True

Latency time: Publishing 2 edge to 1 controller
1. Get latency for MQTT publish from Edge_1 & Edge_2 to mqttSubscriber using QoS(0)
2. Get latency for MQTT publish from Edge_1 & Edge_2 to mqttSubscriber using QoS(1) retain=True
3. Get latency for MQTT publish from Edge_1 & Edge_2 to mqttSubscriber using QoS(2) retain=True

Latency time: Subscribing 2 edge to 1 controller
1. Get latency time for MQTT to subscribe from mqttSubscriber to Edge_1 & Edge_2 using QoS(0) 
2. Get latency time for MQTT to subscribe from mqttSubscriber to Edge_1 & Edge_2 using QoS(1) retain=True
3. Get latency time for MQTT to subscribe from mqttSubscriber to Edge_1 & Edge_2 using QoS(2) retain=True

Latency time: Receiving BLE message from BLE(Edge_1) 
1. Get latency time for bleClient to receive message from BLE(Edge_1)

Maximum packet size: Capped limit for bleClient to receive message
1. Get average packet size in Bytes 
2. Get maximum packet size in Bytes

High Availability:
No network outage

Low Availability:
1. Controller loses Wi-Fi connection
2. Edge_1 loses Wi-Fi connection
3. Edge_2 loses Wi-Fi connection
